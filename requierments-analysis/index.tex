\chapter*{I. Introduction}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{I.1. Application's overview}
\section*{I.1. Application's overview}

Clink is a web application that specializes in uploading and retrieving audio files. On upload, a number of tags are generated automatically and associated with the given audio file which can then be used for queries.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{I.2. Constraints}
\section*{I.2. Constraints}

Any further described functionality will be guaranteed to work on Google Chrome 77.0.3865 (or newer) running on machines using as operating system Windows 10 build 18362 (or newer) or Ubuntu 18.04.3 (or newer). At the same time the width of the screen used while browsing the application must be at least 1200 pixels. For any other configurations the application is not guaranteed to work as described further.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{II.1. Functionalities}
\section*{II.1. Functionalities}

Functionalities present in the minimum viable product (MVP) include beeing able to upload, listen or download audio files. On upload, a number of tags will be automatically generated and associated with the given file. A user can also query the existing base of audio files with filters using the tags. An example of a query is 'give me all audio files on the platform that contain bark and applause'. The available tags an user wil be able to choose from are: Accelerating and revving and vroom, Accordion, Acoustic guitar, Applause, Bark, Bass drum, Bass guitar, Bathtub (filling or washing), Bicycle bell, Burping and eructation, Bus, Buzz, Car passing by, Cheering, Chewing and mastication, Child speech and kid speaking, Chink and clink, Chirp and tweet, Church bell, Clapping, Computer keyboard, Crackle, Cricket, Crowd, Cupboard open or close, Cutlery and silverware, Dishes and pots and pans, Drawer open or close, Drip, Electric guitar, Fart, Female singing, Female speech and woman speaking, Fill (with liquid), Finger snapping, Frying (food), Gasp, Glockenspiel, Gong, Gurgling, Harmonica, Hi-hat, Hiss, Keys jangling, Knock, Male singing, Male speech and man speaking, Marimba and xylophone, Mechanical fan, Meow, Microwave oven, Motorcycle, Printer, Purr, Race car and auto racing, Raindrop, Run, Scissors, Screaming, Shatter, Sigh, Sink (filling or washing), Skateboard, Slam, Sneeze, Squeak, Stream,Strum, Tap, Tick-tock, Toilet flush, Traffic noise and roadway noise, Trickle and dribble, Walk and footsteps, Water tap and faucet, Waves and surf, Whispering, Writing, Yell, Zipper (clothing).

\section*{III.1. Functionalities}
A set of additional features can be added to the MVP based on the time remaining after finishing it. These features include uploading videos, tagging videos from youtube by providing only an url to the video, users beeing able to manually specify when the tagging algorithm is not working properly by adding or flagging tags, an authentication system or generating subtitles for a video based on the generated tags.
