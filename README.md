# Audio Tagging

## Description

Some sounds are distinct and instantly recognizable, like a baby’s laugh or the strum of a guitar. Other sounds are difficult to pinpoint. If you close your eyes, could you tell the difference between the sound of a chainsaw and the sound of a blender?

Because of the vastness of sounds we experience, no reliable automatic general-purpose audio tagging systems exist. A significant amount of manual effort goes into tasks like annotating sound collections and providing captions for non-speech events in audiovisual content.

Using data provided by [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) and and [Google Research’s Machine Perception Team](https://ai.google/research/teams/perception) the goal is to develop an algorithm to tag audio data automatically using a diverse vocabulary of 80 categories.
